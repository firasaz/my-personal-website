    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
    <p>unordered lists are bullet-point elements of a list</p>
    <p>for example</p>
    <ul>
        <li>piris is savage!</li>
        <li>piris has the best koo in the world!</li>
        <li>piris gets random thoughts all the time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
    <p>ordered lists give some form of order to the elements of a list</p>
    <p>for example</p>
    <ol>
        <li>i want to drink milk and watch a podcast in the morning when i wake up</li>
        <li>then i want to get dressed look nice</li>
        <li>lastly but most importantly, conquer the world!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Descriptive Lists</h3>
    <p>this kind of list doesn't give any number or bullet-point to its title. instead it just indents the contents of its title and leaves it as a description to it</p>
    <p>for example</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>I describe HTML as the paper that allows us to write and display stuff on.</dd>

        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>I describe CSS as the different pens and colors we use to write and organize and give style with to our paper.</dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>I cannot compare this with an actual paper since we don't interact with the paper whereas in a website we do.
        In short, JavaScript gives functionality to a webpage on the browser.</dd>
